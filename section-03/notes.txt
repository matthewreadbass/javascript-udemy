JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 2

Activating Strict Mode:

    Makes it easier for you to write more secure JS code
    Must be the first statement in the script (excluding comments)
        'use strict';
    Forbids you writing certain code
    Creates visible errors in the developer console instead of failing silently
    Reserves a short list of variable names for features that might be used later in the programme

Functions

    A piece of code that can by used over and over again in our code
    Can hold multiple lines of code
        function functionName(args) {
            <block-body>;
        }
    Functions are called/run or invoked
        functionName();
    Used to process data

Function Declarations vs Expressions

    Function Declarations:
        function functionName(args) {
            <block-body>;
        }
        
        const constantName = variableName(args);

    Function Expressions:
        const variableName = function (args) {
            <block-body>;
        }

        const constantName = variableName(args);

    With no functionName for function expressions, these functions are called anonymous functions
    Function declarations can be called in the code before they are defined - function expressions cannot
