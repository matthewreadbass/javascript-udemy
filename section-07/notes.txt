What is the DOM/DOM Manipulation?

    DOM stands for Document Object Model
        A structured representation of HTML documents
        Allows JS to access HTML elements & styles to manipulate them
            Change text, HTML attributes and CSS styles
        A connection point between HTML documents and JS code
    DOM Manipulation - Making JS interact with a webpage

    DOM is automatically generated by the browser on HTML load
        Works like a family tree (parent/child/sibling etc elements)
        Everything in the HTML document is represented in the DOM
    
    DOM !== JS
        DOM is part of web APIs
