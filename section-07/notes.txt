What is the DOM/DOM Manipulation?

    DOM stands for Document Object Model
        A structured representation of HTML documents
        Allows JS to access HTML elements & styles to manipulate them
            Change text, HTML attributes and CSS styles
        A connection point between HTML documents and JS code
    DOM Manipulation - Making JS interact with a webpage

    DOM is automatically generated by the browser on HTML load
        Works like a family tree (parent/child/sibling etc elements)
        Everything in the HTML document is represented in the DOM
    
    DOM !== JS
        DOM is part of web APIs

Selecting and Manipulating elements

    Select an element in JS with document.querySelector('.className');
    Use .textContent to show text content of selected element - document.querySelector('.className').textContent;
    Can use to set content tosomething elements
        document.querySelector('.className').textContent = 'New String';

Handling Click Events

    Code reacts to something that happens in the DOM
    Use an 'event listener'
        An event is something that happens on the page
        Use an event listener to wait for a certain event to happen and then react to interact
            document.querySelector('.className').addEventListener('typeOfEvent', function() {<function-body>});
            We don't call the function
                JS engine will call the function as soon as the event happens
