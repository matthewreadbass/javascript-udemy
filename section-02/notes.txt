JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language
JavaScript is the verbs of web development (HTML = nouns & CSS = adjectives)

Modern JavaScript started with the release of ES6/ES2015

Seperate concerns by writing individual script.js files and then referencing them in the <body> tag
  - <script src="script.js"></script>

Usually, JS is attached to web pages, so needs to be attached to an .html document
  - write JS using <script> tags

A value is the most fundamental unit of information in JS - strings, numbers, booleans etc.
  - store in variables (declare)
    - let firstName = "Matthew";

  - variable names can only contain letters, numbers, _ and $
